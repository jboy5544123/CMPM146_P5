Our Search function calls the graph function which finds states that the
current state can go to with the items it has in it.

Then these states are run through our heuristic function which does a handful
of checks and either returns 0 if it is the goal, the total time of the
function we are trying to do or inf if it is violating a rule.

For example if we already have a furnace and a stone pickaxe, there is
no need for more cobble stone so we will not search through a state that
increases our cobble stone.
